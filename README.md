# Joe's README

Everyone works differently. It takes time to learn how people like to work; what makes them tick; what annoys them; do you like quiet time, or prefer Spotify cranked up to 11?
The idea for this README came from [Sophie Shepherd](https://github.com/sophshep) who I also "borrowed" the 1:1 template from üòâ

## The TL;DR

* I love what I do
> Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life.
> - [Various](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2014/09/02/job-love/)
* I value honesty, openness and people that ask questions when they don't know something
* I sometimes need quiet time, especially when I have a task that needs focus, or is repetitive/dull, such as admin!
* My mind works in solutions, so don't be surprised if I want to jump straight in to some code or data after a meeting
* I'm very much a DIY kind of guy, which leads in to the next point...
* I find it hard to not help, even if it's not my job. This can sometimes mean I lose track of time
* I like to know when I've done a good job. Even the small wins spur me on to get the next task done even better.
* I don't pretend to know everything, and will sometimes ask very stupid questions.
* There is no perfect manager, and I'm always learning. If I do or say something wrong or that offends you, tell me and I'll make sure to learn from it

## What I expect from my team

**Talk**

A team with all of the information will deliver better results. If you are unsure on something, ask questions, give opinions and don't be afraid of being wrong.

**Think**

A task may seem pointless, but it is a piece of a large jigsaw. Without it, the picture would be incomplete.

**Try**

If you are stuck, try and find the solution yourself first, and if you're still none the wiser, ask for help. You'll receive much more support if you can show you've tried. [Google it](https://www.google.co.uk)

**Not my Job, mate!** 

If you see something is wrong, don't just walk on by. If you can fix it, do it; if you can't, raise it. You won't be shot for pointing out a problem ü§ó

**Be honest** 

Raise your hand early if a deadline is going to be missed. If you're being asked to carry out unreasonable tasks, let me know. If I'm the one asking, let my manager or HR know!

**Take a break!**

I might send you a Slack message at 10pm. I don't expect a reply until the next time you're online.


## What my team can expect from me

**We are one team**

Everything I expect of you, I expect of myself as well 

**One Goal**

We should all be working towards the same goal. If it isn't clear, speak up. Ask Questions. If you don't know, someone else might be the same!

**Door is always open** 

If you send me a message, through whatever channel, I'll answer it ASAP. I tend to work from quite early (my commute starts at 6am...), and also quite late (young family = never a quiet moment). If I don't answer straight away, it is for a good reason üò¥ That being said, I will take breaks, so be assured the silence isn't personal!
If I can answer a question, I will, and if I don't know, I'll say so and then find out.

**We're in this together** 

Don't be afraid of failing. You should know that you can push yourself and try new ideas. I don't like blame cultures, and I hope you don't either üôÇ

## How I work for my direct reports

To quote [Scott Burns' README](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1PE2OmkVykdZYF2QzmJ-ZUHqBAxnnsbnMsd19z3qLWNI/edit#slide=id.g326aa7ae8d_0_178), "I believe managers work **for** their direct reports". My job is to help you do your best work, and these are some ways I do that.

### Meetings
* We'll sit down every week for 30 minutes and you'll have my full concentration. We can discuss life, career, projects and anything else that you'd like. To help make use of the time, I ask that you complete the 1:1 template for that week to help us keep on track.
* If I think you should sit in on a meeting, I'll ask if you're available, and sometimes I might ask to join your meetings if I have an interest. I'm not checking up on you, I just like to 

### Communication
* I don't want to smother you with check-ins. If you have something to let me know about, I trust you will ü§û If you'd prefer daily chats, let me know and we'll put a process in to make it work.
* As we have infinite routes of communication, I'll leave it to you to decide which one is right for the message you're sending. If you're going to be late in, a Slack message is fine. If you ill, drop it in an email. Anything serious, let's grab a coffee and speak in person ‚òïÔ∏è

### Feedback
* Nobody likes surprises, so I like to give constant feedback, which means reviews are quick and pain-free! üôå
* If you have feedback for me, don't worry, I can take it, I'm a real grown up (apart from when I'm surrounded with Lego!). If you can't tell me, speak to HR or my manager ü•∫
* If we're giving feedback, make is useful. The [feedback equation](https://larahogan.me/blog/feedback-equation/) is a great approach by Lara Hogan.
